### Objective

The goal of current structure is to organize by components in order to match both frontend and backend structure.

Folders are broken down into 3 parts:

- common
- pages
- reducers

### [Common](./common/README.md)

Common folder contains functions, or constants that are globally used through out the application.

### [Pages](./pages/README.md)

Pages folder contains all components that are used in this application. Each component has its own name and inside will have components folder as well as action and reducer if needed.

### [Reducers](./reducers/README.md)

Reducers folder contains combine reducers that can be used through out the application.
