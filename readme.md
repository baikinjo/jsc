# Jungle Scout Code Challenge

This application is built with React and Redux on the frontend with MongoDB, Node, and Express on the backend.

## Getting Started

On the root directory run:

    npm run dev-install

Once installation is complete, run:

    npm run dev

Then [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000) will automatically open.
Port for backend is [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
