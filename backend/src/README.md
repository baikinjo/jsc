### Objective

The goal of current structure is to organize by components in order to match both frontend and backend structure.

Folders are broken down into 3 parts:

- common
- pages
- routes

### [Common](./common/README.md)

Common folder contains functions, or constants that are globally used through out the application.

### [Pages](./pages/README.md)

Pages folder contains all components that are used in this application. Each component has its own name and inside will have components folder.

### [Reducers](./routes/README.md)

Routes folder contains combine api routes that can be used through out the application.
